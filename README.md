# US-Home-Prices-Factors
roject Overview: This data science project focuses on predicting home prices using various economic and demographic factors. We will go through the key steps involved in this project.

Step 1: Data Preparation We start by importing the necessary libraries for data manipulation, such as pandas and numpy. The dataset is loaded into a DataFrame from a CSV file named "HOME LC project.csv." To ensure data quality, we remove rows with missing values

Step 2: Data Visualization For a better understanding of the data, we use data visualization libraries like matplotlib and seaborn. We create a pairplot that displays scatter plots and histograms for the selected variables. A correlation matrix is calculated to understand the relationships between variables. A heatmap is generated to visualize the correlation matrix, making it easier to identify significant correlations.

Step 3: Feature Engineering In this example, we create an interaction term by squaring the 'Income' variable and add it as a new feature ('Income_sq'). Feature engineering helps improve the model's predictive power.

Step 4: Model Building We import a linear regression model from the scikit-learn library. The dataset is split into training and testing sets using the train_test_split function. The input features (X) include various economic and demographic factors, and the target variable (y) is 'CSUSHPISA,' representing home prices. The linear regression model is created and trained using the training data.

Step 5: Model Evaluation We assess the model's performance by making predictions on the test set. Key evaluation metrics include: R-squared (RÂ²) to measure the model's goodness of fit. Mean Squared Error (MSE) to assess the average squared difference between actual and predicted values. Mean Absolute Error (MAE) to determine the average absolute difference between actual and predicted values.

Step 6: Interpretation We examine the model's coefficients and intercept to understand the impact of each factor on home prices. A bar plot is created to visualize the coefficients of the input features, indicating their influence on home prices. Conclusion: This data science project demonstrates the process of predicting home prices based on economic and demographic factors. By following these steps, we can build a model that provides insights into the factors affecting home prices. The model's performance can be further improved by refining the feature selection and engineering process.
